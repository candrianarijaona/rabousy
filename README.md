## MySql random data generator

Rabousy lets you generate random data for a MySql Database.

I used to use it when I started a new project with a whole new database, and I'm too lazy to think about what data should I insert into it.

### Setup
Edit file `app/config.php` and set the variable `$config['base_url']`

You are done !
