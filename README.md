## MySql random data generator

![logo](https://github.com/crazafimahatratra/rabousy/blob/develop/assets/img/logo_big.png "Rabousy")

Rabousy lets you generate random data for a MySql Database.

I used to use it when I started a new project with a whole new database, and I'm too lazy to think about what data should I insert into it.

## Create your project:

    $ composer update -o

### Run it:

1. `$ cd rabousy`
2. `$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8888 -t public public/index.php`
3. Browse to http://localhost:8888

## Key directories

* `app`: Application code
* `app/src`: All class files within the Core namespace
* `app/views`: Php template files
* `public`: Webserver root
* `vendor`: Composer dependencies

## Key files

* `public/index.php`: Entry point to application
* `app/settings.php`: Configuration


You are done !
